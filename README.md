# Adversarial Search  
## Game  
In this chapter we cover **competitive environments**, in which the agents’ goals are in conflict, giving rise to **adversarial search** problems—often known as **games**.  

In AI, the most common games are of a rather specialized kind—what game theorists call deterministic, turn-taking, two-player, **zero-sum games** of **perfect information** (such as chess). In our terminology, this means deterministic, fully observable environments in which two agents act alternately and in which the utility values at the end of the game are always equal and opposite. For example, if one player wins a game of chess, the other player necessarily loses. It is this opposition between the agents’ utility functions that makes the situation adversarial.
